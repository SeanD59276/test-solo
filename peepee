My ego
	Part of me wants to be a teacher and leader, a big decision maker whoes opinion is valued. I need to ignore that for now. keep my head down, stay humble, learn and take action. when others ask for guidance I can teach. arguing is useless, as is teaching people who dont respect my opinion. why should they respect my opinion if I am a loser? stay humble, be the apprentice, help others when I can, but understand that they need to want your help, you cant force it on them.
